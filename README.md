Project topic: Developing a sentiment-based model to predict cryptocurrency price fluctuations

Project Overview: Social media platforms such as Twitter are among the main sources where information about crypto sentiments can be extracted. The scope of the project is to use the free Twitter API to collect tweets over a given period of time and use this data to analyze the general sentiment about crypto-currency. In addition to that, the price movements of a crypto-currency (e.g. bitcoin) will be collected over that same period of time. The goal is to predict the price movement for the hours that follow using the sentiment scores mentioned previously. Data will be integrated from two different real-time sources, namely the Twitter API and a crypto-currency data provider such as CoinAPI. The features will then be extracted and prepared for analysis. An additional potential scope for this project is using cloud capabilities to reliably collect real-time data over a longer time span.
